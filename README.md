Pipes still generally do the same thing. Some GUIs and recipes have changed (check NEI for recipes).

#### Experimental Pipes ####

Power Switch Pipe

Just a nifty little pipe with nice texture effects. Complete credits to ABO for the idea (the code is original though).

Closed Pipe

This pipe has 3 functions:

1. Acts like a normal pipe when transporting items.

2. Acts like a void pipe in that it never drops items.

3. Stores the items it "drops" inside an buffer. This buffer will destroy the oldest stack to make space for new stack when full.

Closed pipes also have a "closed" gate trigger which activates when the buffer has item(s) inside.
